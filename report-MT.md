The project is coming along pretty well - preliminary research and learning is mostly complete, and
code is starting to be written.  I'm starting by solving a simplified problem since doing so will
highlight any design issues without worrying about unnecessary complexity; instead of experimenting
with building part of a full image editor (which is full of small and uninteresting details that
take time to implement), I have decided to simplify things to an image with a single stack of
effects applied to one layer.  This 'prototype' version is looking to be working by the end of this
term or early next term.
